<h1>About me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Matthew Blau and I am a driven software and DevOps engineer who thrives on a challenge and learning new technologies.
    This website was coded by me using HTML, Bootstrap 4, and the Starlette web framework and is continously deployed to DigitalOcean's app platform. I am able to hit the ground running
    with any technology or system that I interact with, I pick up new skills quickly, and can be productive with a new technology within a week of using it.
    I am skilled in Python primarily but can pick up new languages as required. I enjoy all things tech and enjoy making an impact wherever I am.</p>
